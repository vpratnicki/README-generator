# README Generator

## Description

While it may be often overlooked, adding a thorough, high-quality README file to an app is important! This is where users learn how to use and install the app, as well as how they can report issues and contribute to your app. Unfortunately creating these files can be time consuming and even setting up the template can feel like a chore!

This README Generator not only saves time but it ensures important sections are not left off.  The generator takes care of formatting all of the markdown syntax so that you can focus on creating the content needed for the README.

## Usage

Use this README generator for your next project! It will speed up the process of creating your README and will ensure you are not missing an important section.
